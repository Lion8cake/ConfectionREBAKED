HallowTreeIcon - Removed because it was the old graphic for the world creation screen
ConfectionTreeIcon - ^ same reason
BothTrees - ^^ same again

Confection.png - was the old tree overlay, it was a direct recreation from the fandom fan ideas wiki and was made before altlib's 
icon stuff was made and has never been seen ingame

Confection_old.png - was another unused overlay for the confection trees before permission to use the fan wiki sprite

SugarHigh - there was a planned debuff for the saccharite lash to inflict enemies with a debuff when hit that would decrease defence. Due to defence decreasment and the
infliction of debuffs through whips being too hard was scraped in favor for giving the player a positive buff when striking an npc

CrazyCone - Old crazy cone texture back in 2021, may become used at some point so here if need be

NeapoliniteCookies - Plans for cookies to circle players wearing the neapolinite armour, the visuals never looked nice but may return later which is why they are here

ConfectionZenithFull - Before the drama with altlib that happened late febuary 2023 these were the planed to be the textures for the zenith icon. ofc that never happened
ConfectionZenithLeft - ^ this
ConfectionZenithRight - ^^ this again
