The Confection REBAKED (Alternate Hallow)
=========================================
Confection version 0.30.0 (Rewrite Major Update)
Welcome to THE CONFECTION
The Confection REBAKED is a mod that adds in an altenate biome to the hallowed called the Confection. This works similarly to how the corruption and crimson works in the game.
This mod replaces some content found within the hallow while there are still some bits of content missing, a full playthrough is able to be played in the confection.
The confection is a biome filled with lots of sweet treats ranging from icescream trees to coco powder sand. It even effects what items the mech bosses drop.

The Confection was a concept made back in 2014 by Snickerbobble that contains sprites and very well made concepts for lots of the confection's content. In June 2021 this concept would be picked up by Lion8cake and worked on ever since to bring the first ever fully finished alternate hallow to terraria/tmodloader.
The people behind the Confection has also made a fully finished mod called the Depths, it does a very similar thing to the Confection but replaces the underworld instead of the hallow.

This mod contains some mod support features, the supported mods are below
Achievement Mod - download and use the Achievement Mod to see three new achievements to collect
Fargo's Best of Both Worlds - download and use Fargo's BoBW, this allows for the creation of dual good worlds without the use of a drunk seed
Biome Lava - download and use the Biome Lava mod to have the confection have its own special lava texture

Various notes:
Drunk seed allows for you to use both the Confection and Hallow if entirely replacing a biome is not your thing
Full Don't dig up and other seed support for any playthrough you might enjoy
This mod contains various systems that allow for dynamic support with Modded Items, NPCs, Bosses and more allowing for most mods to be automatically compatible
Custom world creation texture to tell you which good you got apon creating a world
Full controller support - if your mouse is broken, fear not you can play on a console controller
Full Multiplayer support - feel free to eat well with a friend
